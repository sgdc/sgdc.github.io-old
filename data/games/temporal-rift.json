My brother helped modify art assets so they could be used for our purposes and my sister made level music for the first 2 levels and made level music for levels 3 and 4. There is no exit in level 4. Play as a time traveler whose time travel device cannot gain enough power to boost him back to his own time in this 2D platformer.",
